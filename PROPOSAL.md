# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

- Aleksandr Gaziiantc
- Jesse Lam

# Intentions: ASCII game engine

- 2D Game library

- Can draw images (maybe even a map) (the map will be a really big image btw) (40mb per machine trust real fr)

    - worst compression ever to deal with that

- Multiplayer (hopefully not copy pasted from a lab) P2P but not really more like what among us does

- Input (and output potentially, depends really)

- Maybe possibly SDL depending on if we give up or something

# Intended Usage:

- you make suspicious ascii games and whatnot (will update once we make our game)

# Technical Details:

- idk use ncurses or smth we will figure it out trust maybe sdl (maybe vulkan (maybe))

- Budget sprite drawing

- Vector2 library (our own)

- WASD Movement toggle input, kind of like a joystick (GLFW but worse)

- UDP networking library (our own)

- Plan: finish the base lib after 1.5 weeks, and then we try to make a demo
